This repository contains the following files:

- Library that allow accessing RAPL registers: rapl_lib.c rapl_utils
- Class to obtain RAPL MSRs information from Java: util.EnergyMetric

Some information about RAPL and rapl_utils:
- RAPL allows to query internal power meters that are exposed through MSRs.
- Power meter registers in RAPL do not trigger an interruption on overflow, as hardware performance counters do.
- rapl_utils Provide access to the energy status and units provided by MSRs of RAPL which include (MSR_RAPL_POWER_UNIT, MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_PP0_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_PP1_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_DRAM_ENERGY_STATUS).
- rapl_utils access RAPL MSR without perf tool. 

- RAPL domains are: PKG (socket), PP0 (Core power plane), PP1 (uncore/graphics power plane) and DRAM
- PP1 domain only available in some clients; DRAM domain available only in server.
- The RAPL counters are available on Intel processors: SandyBridge, IvyBridge, Haswell. The server processors (e.g., SandyBridge-EP) add a third counter to measure DRAM power consumption.
- To access RAPL the following conditions should be met: 1) Intel supported cpu model (SandyBridge, IvyBridge, etc); 2) /dev/cpu/?/msr driver must be enabled and permissions set to allow read access.
- If using perf tool then support for perf_event_open() should be enabled, and to have /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 1.
