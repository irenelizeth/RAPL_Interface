This repository contains the following files:

- Library that allow accessing RAPL registers: rapl_lib.c rapl_utils
- Class to obtain RAPL MSRs information from Java: util.EnergyMetric

Some information about RAPL and rapl_utils:
- Provide access to the energy status and units MSRs of RAPL which include (MSR_RAPL_POWER_UNIT,
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_PP0_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_PP1_ENERGY_STATUS, MSR_DRAM_ENERGY_STATUS).
- RAPL domains are: PKG (socket), PP0 (Core power plane), PP1 (uncore/graphics power plane) and DRAM
- PP1 domain only available in some clients; DRAM domain available only in server.
- To access RAPL the following conditions should be met: 1) /dev/cpu/?/msr driver must be enabled and permissions set to allow read access; 2) Support for perf_event_open(), and to have /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid < 1.
